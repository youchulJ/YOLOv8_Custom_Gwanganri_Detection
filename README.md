## Introduction
In this project, we implement YOLOv8 for object detection on a custom dataset. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, and YOLOv8 represents one of the latest iterations with improvements in accuracy and speed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- CUDA-enabled GPU (recommended for faster training)
- Other dependencies (list them if necessary)

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Download or prepare your custom dataset and follow the instructions in the [Custom Dataset](#custom-dataset) section.

4. Proceed with training and inference as described in the respective sections.

## Custom Dataset
To use YOLOv8 with a custom dataset, you should organize your dataset in the YOLO format. Here are some essential steps:

1. Prepare your dataset images and annotations.

2. Create a data configuration file that specifies the paths to your dataset and class labels.

3. Configure YOLOv8 to use your data configuration.

## Training
In the training section, describe how to train the YOLOv8 model on your custom dataset. Include details on hyperparameters, training options, and any additional tips or considerations.

## Inference
Explain how to perform inference using the trained model. Provide sample code and instructions on how to use the model for object detection on new images or videos.

## Results
Present the results of your YOLOv8 model on the custom dataset. Include performance metrics, visualizations, and any insights gained from the object detection results.
